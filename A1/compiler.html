<h3>Compiling the PL0 compiler</h3>

<font color="blue">Sections in blue refer to the compilers used for
  assignments 2 and 3.</font>

<h4>Using Eclipse</h4>

If you are using Eclipse then it will automatically compile the Java
source files.
<font color="blue">
For the compiler generated via Java-CUP (assignments 2 and 3):
<ul>
  <li>to run the Java-CUP parser generator to rebuild CUPParser.java and
  CUPTokens.java from PL0.cup run the ant script <i>build-cup.xml</i>
  from within Eclipse
  </li>
  <li>you also need to refresh the parser files after running the ant
  script, but you can set up Eclipse to do this automatically as part
  of running the ant script</li>
  <li>to run the JFlex lexical analyser generator to build Lexer.java from
  PL0.flex run the ant script <i>build-flex.xml</i> from within
  Eclipse, and refresh the parser files; you should only need to
  generate Lexer.java once.
</ul>
</font>

<!--
<h4>Using Unix shell scripts</h4>

Within the assignment compiler directory there are a number of Unix shell
scripts to compile and run the PL0 compiler.
You can make (i.e., compile) the PL0 compiler using the Unix shell
script <i>compile</i>, i.e., run
<ul>
      ./compile
</ul>
The Java source code for the compiler is all in the
subdirectory <i>src</i>. 
See the the accompanying description of the source files.
<p>
The compilation process places the compiled class files in the
subdirectory build.
The main program is in package pl0 and file PL0.java.
<p>
There is also an ant script called <i>build.xml</i>.

<h3>Running the PL0 compiler under Eclipse</h3>

You'll need to set up a run configuration to run the PL0 compiler
under Eclipse.
While in the assignment compiler Eclipse project that you have
imported. 
<ul>
 <li>Select Run>Run Configurations...
 <li>Select Java Application
 <li>Press the new icon (the box with the "+" in the corner)
 <li>Give your new configuration a name (like "A1run")
 <li>The Project field should correspond to the compiler project (eg,
  "T4", "A1")
 <li>Under the "Main" tab, press "search" under "Main class"
 <li>Select PL0_RD (for recursive descent) or 
    <font color="blue">PL0_LALR (for Java-CUP version)</font> from package pl0
 <li>Select the "Arguments" tab
 <li>Insert in text box 
     <ul>
       -v "${resource_loc}"
     </ul>
     These are the arguments to the PL0 compiler, which are described
     in more detail below. 
     If the path name to your workspace includes blanks,
     don't forget to put the quotes around ${resource_loc}.
     In Eclipse ${resource_loc} is replaced by the currently selected file. 
     Hence to compile a PL0 program, 
     you should first select the PL0 program,
     e.g., select "test-pgm/test-based-write1.pl0" 
     (which is the closest PL0 gets to a "Hello World" program)
     under Eclipse, and then select "Run>Run" to run the run
     configuration that you previously ran, or "Run>Run
     Configurations..." to switch to a different configuration, or
     create a new configuration.
  </ul>
</ul>
There is a suite of test PL0 programs within the
subdirectory <i>test-pgm</i>. 

When you run a program the output of the compiler appears in the
"Console" window (usually under the program).

<ul>

<br>

</ul>

<br>

<br><br>

</ul>
The line containing "1" is the output produced by this particular
(simple) PL0 program.

<!--
<p>
Within tests there is a Unix shell script <i>mkresult</i>,
which runs the PL0 compiler 
(you must have already compiled the compiler)
on a test file passed as an argument, e.g.,
within directory <i>tests</i> run
<ul>
  ./mkresult test-write1.pl0
</ul>
<p>
The <i>mkresult</i> shell script also saves copies of the
standard output produced by the compiler in
subdirectory <i>results</i> under the name 
<i>r-test-write1.pl0</i> and
the standard error output in subdirectory <i>errors</i> under the
name <i>e-test-write1.pl0</i>. 
<p>
The shell script <i>runtests</i> in the assignment directory will run
<mkresult</i> on every test program file within the subdirectory 
<i>test-pgm</i>.
A test program file must start with "test".
<p>
You should develop your own set of test cases to thoroughly test 
your compiler.

<h3>Compiler options</h3>

If a compilation of a PL0 program is successful, 
the compiler normally runs the interpreter to execute the generated code.
However there are a number of compiler parameters that can change its
behaviour.
<ul>
          PL0 - PL0 Compiler
      <br>Usage: java pl0.PL0 [-cdhptv] <i>filename.pl0</i> ]
      <br>  -d  =  debug messages on (verbose trace of parsing, etc.)
      <br>  -p  =  parse only (nonstatic check or code generation)
      <br>  -c  =  parse and static check only (no code generation)
      <br>  -v  =  verbose output of generated code
      <br>  -t  =  trace execution of resulting code (verbose)
      <br>  -h  =  output this usage information
      <br> <i>filename.pl0</i> is compiled, and if there are no errors
            the generated code is executed unless -p or -c are given.
</ul>
The <b>-p</b> option only runs the parsing phase.
The <b>-d</b> option gives a blow-by-blow (very verbose) trace of
the recursive descent parsing process (for assignment 1 compiler) or
<font color="blue"> the shift-reduce parsing process (for assignment 2 and 3 compilers).</font>
<p>
The <b>-t</b> option is useful for debugging problems with the code
      your compiler generates; it gives a very verbose
      blow-by-blow trace of the execution of the code.
<p>
The compiler switches are also documented at the start of PL0_RD.java
or <font color="blue"> PL0_LALR.java.</font>
