<h1>PL0 Compiler Java Source Code (Recursive descent version)</h1>
<p>
The Java files that make up the compiler are listed below, along with a
brief description of their purpose. 
The source code for the compiler is divided into the following packages:
<ul>
  <li><b>pl0</b>
    contains the Java files for the main program for the compiler
  </li>
  <li><b>parser</b>
    contains the Java files to handle scanning and parsing as well
    as defining the lexical tokens
  </li>
  <li><b>tree</b>
    contains the abstract syntax tree, the static semantic checker and
    the code generator
  </li>
  <li><b>syms</b>
    contains the symbol table, its entries, and type descriptors
  </li>
  <li><b>machine</b>
    contains the Java files for the stack machine interpreter,
    instruction set operation codes, and instructions.
  </li>
  <li><b>source</b>
    contains the Java files for processing the source input and
    handling error messages
  </li>
</ul>
 
 
<h2>Package pl0</h2>
<p>
You shouldn't need to look in here too much.
The main program defines some command line arguments that may be
useful. 
<ul>
  <li><b>PL0_RD.java</b>
    (class)
    The main program for the compiler 
    ("RD" stands for recursive descent).
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Package machine</h2>
<p>
You may want to look inside the stack machine at some stage to work
out exactly what an instruction does.
<ul>
 <li><b>Instruction.java</b>
    (class)
    Defines the different formats of instruction.
  </li>
  <li><b>Operation.java</b>
  (enumeration)
  Define the operation codes for the stack machine.
  </li>
  <li><b>StackMachine.java</b>
    (class)
    Implements an interpreter for the Stack Machine.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Package parser</h2>
<p>
You'll need to understand how the Parser works and what the lexical
Tokens are, but you shouldn't need to look at the Scanner.
<ul>
  <li><b>IdentifierToken.java</b> 
    (class, extends LexicalToken)
    Subclass of token for identifier tokens only.
  </li>
  <li><b>LexicalToken.java</b> 
    (class)
    Defines the lexical token passed between the scanner and parser.
  </li>
  <li><b>NumberToken.java</b>
    (class, extends LexicalToken)
    Subclass of token for integer number tokens only.
  </li>
  <li><b>Parser.java</b>
    (class)
    The parser recognises the input program and creates and
    abstract syntax tree and symbol table.
    This version uses a recursive descent parser.
  </li>
  <li><b>Scanner.java</b>
    (class)
    The scanner recognises the input character stream and splits
    it up into a stream of lexical tokens.
  </li>
  <li><b>Token.java</b>
    (class)
    Defines the lexical tokens.
  </li>
  <li><b>TokenSet.java</b>
    (class)
    Defines types and operations on sets of Tokens.
  </li>
  <li><b>TokenStream.java</b>
    (class)
    Handles access to the stream of tokens from input source from the
    parser. Contains generic syntax error recovery methods.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Package tree</h2>
<p>
You'll need to know the structure of the Abstract Syntax Tree and the
definitions of the Operators.
Then you'll need to understand how the StaticChecker and CodeGenerator
work. These both implement the Visitor interfaces to traverse the abstract
syntax tree.
<ul>
  <li><b>Code.java</b>
    (class)
    Data structure for a sequence of instructions used in the code
    generation.
  </li>
  <li><b>CodeGenerator.java</b>
    (class, implements TreeTransform, ExpTransform, and StatementTransform)
    Implements the code generation for the compiler via a tree traversal.
    You'll need to modify this to generate code for the extra statements.
  </li>
  <li><b>ConstExp.java</b>
    (class)
    Symbolic constant expressions are evaluated at compile time.
    This class provides tree nodes to represent constants and evaluate
    them.
  </li>
  <li><b>DeclNode.java</b>
    (class)
    This class provides the abstract syntax tree nodes representing
    declarations lists and procedure declarations.
  </li>
  <li><b>DeclVisitor.java</b>
    (interface)
    Visitor interface for declarations and procedures (including main program).
  </li>
  <li><b>ExpNode.java</b>
    (class)
    Defines the nodes in the abstract syntax tree for expressions
    as well as methods for allowing tree traversals using the visitor pattern.
  </li>
  <li><b>ExpTransform.java</b>
    (interface)
    Visitor interface for expressions returning a transformed expression.
  </li>
  <li><b>Operator.java</b>
    (enumeration)
    Enumeration for the binary and unary operators for the abstract syntax tree.
  </li>
  <li><b>Procedures.java</b>
    (class)
    Provides data structure to keep track of the start and finish
    addresses of procedures. Also used to provide a run-time stack
    trace (on a run-time error).
  </li>
  <li><b>StatementNode.java</b>
    (class)
    Defines the nodes in the abstract syntax tree for statements 
    as well as methods for allowing tree traversals using the visitor pattern.
    You'll need to modify this to generate the appropriate abstract
    syntax tree structure.
  </li>
  <li><b>StatementTransform.java</b>
    (interface)
    Visitor interface for statement transformation (used in code generation).
  </li>
  <li><b>StatementVisitor.java</b>
    (interface)
    Visitor interface for statements (used by static checker).
  </li>
  <li><b>StaticChecker.java</b>
    (class, implements TreeVisitor, ExpTransform, and StatementVisitor) 
    Implements the static (type) checking for the compiler via
    a tree traversal.
    You'll need to modify this to static check the new constructs.
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Package syms</h2>
<p>
This package defines the symbol table and its entries as well as type descriptors.
<ul>
  <li><b>Predefined.java</b>
    (class)
    Handles all the predefined constants, types and operators.
  </li>
  <li><b>Scope.java</b>

    Provides a single scope within the symbol table.
  </li>
  <li><b>SymEntry.java</b>
    (class)
    Defines the symbol table entries for CONST, TYPE, VAR and 
    PROCEDURE identifiers, and operators.
  </li>
  <li><b>SymbolTable.java</b>

    each Scope (procedure, main program or predefined scope) that
    contain entries (SymEntry) for each identifier.
    Handles constant, variable, type, procedure identifiers, 
    as well as the type structures.

  </li>
  <li><b>TypeTest.java</b>
    (JUnit test class)
    JUnit test for types.
  </li>
